# üè† Real Estate Price Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts real estate prices based on property features using multiple regression models. This project compares the performance of **Linear Regression**, **Decision Tree Regressor**, and **Random Forest Regressor** using **MSE** and **RMSE** as evaluation metrics.

---

## üìå Overview

The aim of this project is to build a price prediction engine for real estate properties using regression techniques. The models are trained on features like area, number of bedrooms, and location to estimate prices.

    3. INDUS     proportion of non-retail business acres per town
    4. CHAS      Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds 
                 river; 0 otherwise)
    5. NOX       nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
    6. RM        average number of rooms per dwelling
    7. AGE       proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
    8. DIS       weighted distances to five Boston employment centres

    10. TAX      full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
    11. PTRATIO  pupil-teacher ratio by town
    12. B        1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks 
                 by town
    13. LSTAT    % lower status of the population
    14. MEDV     Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's

## üìä Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated using:

- **MSE** (Mean Squared Error)
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)
